### Comment-Classification
- Machine learning project based on classification task. 
- Involves NLP (Natural Language Processing), since textual data
- [Dataset available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data)
- Task is to classify the comments as `toxic`, `sever toxic`, `obscene`, `threat`, `insult`, or `identity hate` by predicting the probabilty
- Project implemented using Python as programming language
- While implementing, usage of NLTK, pre-processing techniques like lemmatization, TF-IDF vectorization (for feature extraction) to encode categorical variables utilised
- Jupyter Notebook with .ipynb extension consists of the code implementation
